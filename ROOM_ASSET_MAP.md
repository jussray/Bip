# Se'kret Bip — Room Asset Inventory
# Generated: Phase 1 extraction planning document
# Status: INVENTORY ONLY — no assets deleted or moved

---

## HOW TO READ THIS FILE

- **Source Room** — which room background this element currently lives inside
- **Asset Filename** — current filename (backgrounds) or proposed extraction filename (baked elements)
- **Status** — `production` (live), `archive` (backup copy), `reference` (design mockup only), `baked` (embedded in flat PNG, needs extraction)
- **Recolor** — whether the element is a good candidate for palette-swap color variants
- **Hotspot** — whether this element currently acts as (or should become) an interactive hotspot
- **Extraction Priority** — `HIGH` (needed for user room MVP), `MED` (next phase), `LOW` (future)

---

## SECTION 1 — ROOM BACKGROUNDS (Flat PNG composites)

These are fully rendered single-layer PNGs. Each image contains walls, lighting, furniture, and hotspot objects all baked together. Extraction = slicing in Figma/Photoshop to produce separate layers.
